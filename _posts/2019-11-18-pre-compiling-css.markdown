Why use CSS Pre-Processors?

I think that everyone who has used CSS has been annoyed at the fact that it is simply not very comfortable to use - it is the opposite of DRY, and it is honestly rather clumsy.

With CSS Pre-Processors, the experience of designing a web site can be made less clumsy, and more effortless. The hierarchy of the selectors is made visual with nesting. This makes it easier to read, as well as easier to understand it.

Another pro with CSS pre-processors is that it is more powerful so to say, in that you can use variables, and write other code directly in the pre-processor.

However, something sleek and effortless is usually more complex, and that is also the case with Pre-processors. It requires more tools, more setup, and with that requires more time - not only time to setup, but also to maintain, to load the page, etc.. It is also harder to debug.
