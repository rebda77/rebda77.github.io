What are we? Are we humans or are we robots?

A robot.txt is a file that is used to give instructions to "robots" - automatic programs that are used to travel the web, for example spammers when searching for e-mail adresses, or Google to index different content. This file tells these robots what they can access or not.
I have configured this space to apply to all robots, and that it should not visit any pages here.

A humans.txt is a file that tells about the people who have created and contributed to a web site. 
I have configured this file by keeping it short and sweet - by telling who I am, and where I am from.

Humans - hopefully - can also comment on this web site, by using Disqus. I implemented them by copying the code accessed by Disqus, and copying it in the post.html file, in the _layouts folder.
