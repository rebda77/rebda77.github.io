Well what can this be? A static site simply has all its content in the html, rather than storing the content in a database. That makes it secure, and the performance is fast. No updates are necessary. Personally I think that SSGS are a simple and fun way to build a web site. It would be suitable to use especially when you need to have a web site built quickly and securely - maybe for a Kickstarter campaign.

Static site generators can benefit by including open graphs. Open graphs are tags that can be included in the content of a web page, that enables Facebook to use data of a web site. The tags specify what is shown when a web site is shared.
I made use of this on this web site by including tags for the url, images, the title, type, description and tags.
