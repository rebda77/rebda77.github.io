Who am I? My name is Rebecca and I live in Uppsala, I'm studying this course on distance. I've lived in Uppsala my whole life, but I've also lived in Lund as well as Brighton, UK. 

My interests are: reading, running, and baking, but when I really want to relax I like to kick off with a crossword puzzle or play The Sims.
